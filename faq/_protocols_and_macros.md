#### Does a Protocol need a Macro?
**No**, you donâ€™t have to have a Macro for a Protocol. Yet most of the measurements require a Macro since they need to be analyzed further to provide useful information.

#### Can any Protocol run on any Instrument?
**No**, Instruments have different configurations, so Protocols might trigger the wrong lights, or request a sensor that is not available. Make sure that the Protocol is compatible with your Instrument.
