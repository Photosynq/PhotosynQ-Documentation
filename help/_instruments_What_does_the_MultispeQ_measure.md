#### What does the MultispeQ measure?
The standard MultispeQ protocol measures the following parameters*:

| Parameter | What does it mean? |
| ---------- | ------- |
| Light Intensity (PAR) | Photosynthetically active radiation. Fraction of the incoming light (400 nm to 700 nm) which can be utilized to drive photosynthesis|
|Relative Chlorophyll | Otherwise known has "SPAD," relative chlorophyll is a measure of leaf “greenness”. This measurement is often correlated with leaf nitrogen levels|
|Phi2 |Quantum yield of Photosystem II. This measurement is essentially the percentage of incoming light (excited electrons) that go into Photosystem II. Photosystem II is where most light energy is converted into food.|
|PhiNPQ|Ratio of incoming light that goes towards non-photochemical quenching. The plant regulating excess energy in such a way as too reduce damage to the plant. *[Kuhlgert et al. Royal Soc Open Sci. (2016)][doi:10.1098/rsos.160592]*|
|PhiNO|Ratio of incoming light that is lost via non-regulated processes. PhiNO is the combination of a number of unregulated processes whose by-products can inhibit photosynthesis or be harmful to the plant.|
|Leaf Temp Differential| The difference between **Ambient Temperature** and leaf temperature (**contactless_temp**). Negative numbers mean that the leaf is cooler than the surrounding air and vice versa.
|Leaf Angle|The angle of the leaf, from 0 - 90 degrees|
|Ambient Temperature| Ambient temperature in degree Celsius (°C)|
|Ambient Humidity| Relative humidity in percent (%)|
|ECSt| Total magnitude of ECS (electrochromic shift) decay during a light-dark transition|
|vH+|  Proton conductivity of the chloroplast ATP synthase|
|gH+| Steady-state rate of proton flux through the chloroplast ATP synthase|
|absorbance_wavelength|The absorbance of light from each wavelength that passed through the leaf|
|angle_direction|Abbreviated cardinal direction (e.g. NW - North West)|
|B| The raw amount of blue light captured by the PAR sensor
|compass|Cardinal direction in degrees from North|
|compass_direction|Abbreviated cardinal direction (e.g. NW - North West)|
|contactless_temp|Surface temperature in degree Celsius (°C)|
|FmPrime|Maximum variable fluorescence at steady-state conditions|
|FoPrime|Minimum variable fluorescence during dark phase after steady-state|
|Fs|Variable fluorescence at steady-state conditions|
|G| The raw amount of green light captured by the PAR sensor
|LEF|Linear Electron Flux. The total flow of electrons from antennae complexes (where light is captured) into Photosystem II, taking the leaf absorptivity into account. Calculated as LEF = Phi2 x PAR x 0.42|
|NPQt | Estimate of non-photochemical quenching. The amount of incoming light that is regulated away from photosynthetic processes in order to reduce damage to the plant.|
|pressure| Atmospheric pressure (mbar) - This value is not corrected to sea level as found in weather reports|
|pitch|Pitch is the angle the instrument is held along the short axis|
|qL|Fraction of Photosystem II centers which are in the open state|
|R| The raw amount of red light captured by the PAR sensor
|roll|Roll is the angle the instrument is held along the long axis|
|thickness| The thickness of the leaf as measured by the Hall Effect sensor embedded in the MultispeQ clamp.
