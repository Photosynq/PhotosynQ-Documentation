### Edit a Macro
You can change one of your macros or extend an already existing one at any time.

#### Desktop (Google Chrome)
1. Select **Macros** from the left menu bar.
2. Double click on the macro in the list or click on **Edit** in the sidebar.
3. Make your changes to the code.
4. Select **Macro** from the top menu and click on **Save**.
5. Update the description if needed.
6. Close the dialog by selecting **Save**.

***Tip:*** In case you altered a macro someone else had made, change the name too. In this case you only have the option **Save as**.

#### Troubleshooting
If you have issues saving the macro, make sure you check these things first:

- [x] When a Macro is done, make sure the output box is green, indicating that there was no error.
- [x] Make sure you have a name and description.
- [x] Check that the name is not already taken.
