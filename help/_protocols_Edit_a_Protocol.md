### Edit a Protocol

You can change one of your protocols or extend an already existing one at any time.

#### Desktop

1. Select **Protocols** from the left menu bar.
2. Click on the protocol in the list and click on **Edit** in the sidebar.
3. Make your changes to the protocol.
4. Select **Save as...** from the File menu or use the shortcut `CTRL/⌘+⇧+s`.
5. Update the description if needed.
6. Save the changes by **Save As**.

***Tip:*** Often it is easier to start altering an already existing protocol. To save it change the name too and the only option available is **Save as**.

#### Troubleshooting

If you have issues saving the protocol, make sure you check these things first:

- When a Protocol is finished, no warnings or errors are indicated.
- Make sure you have a name, description and category.
- Check that the name is not already taken.
