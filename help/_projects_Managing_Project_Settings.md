### Managing Project Settings
Project settings allow Project Lead's to decide you can contribute data to the project and who can act as an administrator on the project.

1. Select who can contribute to your project by selecting 'anyone' or 'contributors only' from the drop down menu.

***Tip:*** If you have a large project where you may have many different data collectors, then it is easiest to select 'anyone' instead of individually inviting everyone who will collect data. 

2. If you selected 'Collaborators only' you will need to invite each collaborator
3. To invite collaborators, enter their email address in the box 'Invite Collaborator' and click 'Add.'
4. You can add as many collaborators as you need.
5. Each collaborator will receive an invitation email, they are not collaborators until they follow the link in the email.
6. Once you have finished adding collaborators, select 'Create Project.'

***Note:*** All the confirmed collaborators will be listed on the bottom left under 'Collaborators' and all outstanding invitations will be listed on the bottom right under 'Invitations.'
