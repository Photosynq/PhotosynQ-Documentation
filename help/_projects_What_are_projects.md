### What are projects?

Data on the PhotosynQ platform is organized into projects. Project data can be analyzed, shared and discussed in collaboration with the PhotosynQ community. Any member of the PhotosynQ community can create a project or can contribute data to open projects. 

The creator of a project is the **Project Lead**, who:

1. Chooses the measurement protocol to be used

2. Defines the project questions

3. Decides who can contribute to the project

4. Invites **Administrators** and **Collaborators** to the project
