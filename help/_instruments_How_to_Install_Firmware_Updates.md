## How to Install Firmware Updates

Normally, the PhotosynQ apps automatically notify you when there is a new firmware version available for your Instrument. In this case you can follow the instructions, and the apps will download the correct version and install it on your Instrument.

***Note:*** We do not recommend that anyone uploads any other versions of the firmware or from unknown sources, unless you know what you are doing!

### Automatic Firmware Update

When you connect to an Instrument using the mobile app or the desktop app, you will be notified, if there is a firmware update available. Firmware updates usually provide fixes as well as new features. Some new measurement protocols might require the latest firmware, so we strongly recommend to install the updates. Below you find instructions on how to install those updates using the Mobile App (Android) or the Desktop App.

### Manual Firmware Update

**"Pre-releases"** of the firmware are not installed automatically on your Instrument. Go to [Github][Firmware-Github] to download the most recent firmware for your Instrument.

#### Preparation

Make sure you have a verified .hex file from [PhotosynQ][Firmware-Github]. Select the file matching your Instrument name and version (e.g. `multispeq1.ino.hex` for MultispeQ v1.0). Place this file in an easy-to-find location (like your Desktop).

#### Step 1

Connect your Instrument to a USB port. To avoid confusion, make sure it is the only Instrument connected to the USB.
Open the Settings dialog from the left menu bar and connect your Instrument.

Select the **"Check"** button to bring up the firmware update dialog.

#### Step 2

Click on the **"Manual Update" button and select the previously downloaded file. Confirm that you want to update the firmware on your Instrument.

During the upload process, don't close the app, turn of your computer or Instrument.

#### Step 4

If the installation is finished, wait for the Instrument to restart. When the restart is complete, the settings dialog will show up again.

Connect your Instrument and check if the firmware you wanted to install was installed properly.

### Known Issues

When the firmware is transferred to the Instrument, it might be necessary to restart it and/or the desktop app.
Sometimes you have to repeat this step because the Instrument may take a bit longer to boot up the first time.
