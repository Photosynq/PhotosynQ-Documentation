### Project Invitations
You can invite collaborators to your projects and others can invite you to collaborate on their projects.

#### Invite a Collaborator to Your Project
You can invite collaborators to join your project either when you are creating a project, or invite them to an already created project.

To invite collaborators while creating a project:
1. In the **Settings** tab, select **Collaborators only** from the "Who can contribute data to your project" drop down menu
2. Enter the email address of the collaborator you are inviting in the **Invite collaborator** box
3. After typing in the email adress, click the **Add** button. You can invite as many collaborators has you want, and you can choose if you want them to be a collaborator (meaning they can contribute data) or an administrator (meaning they can edit you project)
4. Once you have finished inviting collaborators, click **Save and Finish** from the bottom of the page
