### Coding and Functions

#### Basic Guidelines
+ Document your steps inside the code.
+ Test your code with more than one measurement.
+ Make sure that the code is fast and efficient.
+ Output only what is really necessary to not overwhelm others who will use your macro based analysis.

***Note:*** Try to make your code efficient, since can be used to evaluate several thousand measurements in a row.

#### Code Structure
```javascript
//============================================
// Macro for data evaluation on PhotosynQ.org
// created: 11/3/2016
//============================================

//Define the output object here
var output = {};

//Check if the key time exists in json
if (json.time !== undefined){

	//Add key time and value to output
	output["time"] = json.time;
}

//Return data
return output;
```

**Basic Requirements:**
+ The variable `output` is needed, as well as the `return output` statement at the end.
+ Add a new parameter to your Macro output using: `output['New Parameter'] = "Hello World"`
+ To access parameters from your Measurement use the **Variables** Menu. Variables selected will look like this: `json.variable` in the code.
+ Use the `Raw Trace` in the upper right corner to select a subsection of your trace if available.

### Helper Functions
Some functions are needed over and over again, like calculating the average, finding the maximum, etc. Just pick the function you need from the functions menu and it will get inserted at the position of your cursor into your code. 

```javascript
// Calculate the mean from an array
var values = [1,2,3,4,5,6]
output['Mean'] = MathMEAN(values)
```
***

#### Order Parameters
Sometimes you have multiple parameters calculated. To show the most important parameters first, select **Order Parameters** from the functions Menu. It will insert a piece of code like this:
```javascript
output["order"] = ["P1","P3","P2"];
```

Just replace `P1`, `P2`, etc. with the names of the parameters you want to be ordered and appear on top of the list. Not all parameters need to be listed here.

***

#### Show additional Traces
The recorded trace `json.data_raw` will be shown with a measurement. In case you would like to show some extra traces based on your calculations, just add an array to your output parameters. This array need _more than 4 values_ to be shown as a sparkline.

```javascript
output["Additional Trace"] = [1,3,4,90,87,50,3,2,1,2,7,…];
```

***

#### Show Colors
Sometimes representing a value as a color is more useful than a plain number. These three options are available:
+ Hexadecimal: `#44bd78`
+ RGB (Red, Green, Blue): `rgb(68,189,120)` (values from 0 to 255)
+ RGBA (Red, Green, Blue, alpha): `rgba(68,189,120,0.5)` (values from 0 to 255), (alpha 0 to 1)

```javascript
output['Your Parameter'] = '#44bd78'
output['Your Parameter'] = 'rgb(68,189,120)'
output['Your Parameter'] = 'rgba(68,189,120,0.5)'
```

***

#### Return Feedback
If people take measurements in the field, they might run into quality issues, they cannot identify right away. Based on calculations you can add messages to alert users, that they might have to repeat the measurement. Three types of messages are available:
+ **Info**: Just let users know that (color:blue)
+ **Warning**: Give users a warning, that there might be something wrong and they should take a closer look (color: yellow)
+ **Danger**: Use this message, when you think something went terribly wrong. In the future, measurments containing this message will be flagged as bad datapoints automatically. (color:red)

To add messages, use the Functions menu and select the type of measurement you need. Replace the word `message` with your message.

```javascript
info('message',output);
warning('message',output);
danger('message',output);
```

***

### Restrictions
Some of the functions available in JavaScript are not allowed to be used in macros. All functions that require a user response like `alert`, `confirm` and `prompt` are not allowed. Also defining new functions or overwriting existing functions `function(){…}` is forbidden, as well as extending the prototype library `$.prototype`.
