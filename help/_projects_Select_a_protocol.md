### What is a Protocol?

These are instructions that are sent to the Instrument on how to conduct a measurement. Which parameters you measure will be dependent on which protocol you choose for your Project.

***Tip:*** Read the protocol description carefully to be sure that it is measuring what you want to measure and that it is compatible with your Instrument.

### Choosing a Protocol

#### Choosing 1 suggested protocol

1. Suggested protocols for your Project (based on the Project category) will appear on the left.
2. On the right will be a description of the protocol.
3. Click on the protocol
4. Click on 'Save and Next'

***Note:*** You will only be able to select **one** protocol using this method, if you want to select more than 1 protocol, keep reading...

#### Choosing more than 1 suggested protocol

1. Click on 'Advanced.'
2. A list of all suggested protocols will appear on the left.
3. To select a protocol, click on it or drag it over to the protocol list on the right.
4. Select additional protocols the same as in step #3. **Protocols will run in the order that they are listed on the right**
5. Click on 'Save and Next'

***Tips:***
    - You can change the order of protocols by dragging them up or down the list
    - Hovering over the protocol name will bring up a pop-up window with the protocol description. Click on 'Read More' in the pop up to bring up the full protocol description.

#### Choosing protocols from the whole protocol list

1. If the suggested protocols are not appropriate for your Project, click on 'Advanced' below the suggested protocols
2. Click on 'Click to show all protocols' to bring up the full list of protocols available on PhotosynQ
3. To select a protocol, click on it or drag it over to the protocol list on the right.
4. Select additional protocols the same as in step #3. **Protocols will run in the order that they are listed on the right**
5. Click on 'Save and Next'

***Tips:***
    - You can change the order of protocols by dragging them up or down the list
    - Hovering over the protocol name will bring up a pop-up window with the protocol description. Click on 'Read More' in the pop up to bring up the full protocol description.

### Does the order of Protocols matter?

The protocols will run in the order that you select them. Depending on what you are measuring, it may be important to keep them in a certain order. For example, measure photosynthetic yield before measuring relative chlorophyll content so that the LED's from the relative chlorophyll content measurement do not affect your photosynthetic yield value.
