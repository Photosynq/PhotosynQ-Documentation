### Adding a Project Description

#### Project Description

Type in a project overview, or provide measurement instructions in the Project Description box (you can use [standard markdown](https://daringfireball.net/projects/markdown) to enrich your text).

#### Category

Select one or more project categories from the Category drop down menu, that you feel best describe your project. **At least one project category is required for each project.** These categories help users browse and search for projects.

#### Tags

You have the option to add tags to your projects. An individual tag must be all one word (no spaces).

#### Photos

You can add photos to your project by dragging and dropping them into the Photos box or by clicking in the photos box and selecting your photos.

***Tip:*** Uploading a unique project photo can help you quickly find your project, especially in the Android App
