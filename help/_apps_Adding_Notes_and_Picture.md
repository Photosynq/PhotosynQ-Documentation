### Adding Notes and Pictures

Whether you are in the field, or taking measurements from the PhotosynQ desktop app, after every measurement you can attach a note or picture that will be viewable online. 

#### Mobile App

In the mobile app, you can add notes or pictures to measurements AFTER you have accepted the measurement but BEFORE the measurement has been submitted to the website. Important note: If the measurement has a green check next to it, it has been submitted to the website and cannot be modified.

To modify a measurement:

1. Go to the Measurements screen on your Mobile App. Press and hold the measurement(s) you want to modify. 
2. To delete the measurement, select the *Trash* icon.
3. To add a note, select the *Note* icon from the menu at the top of the screen, type the note into the textbox and select **Save Note**. 
4. To add a picture, select the *Camera* icon from the menu at the top of the screen, take the picture and select **OK**

***Note: if you go back and add another note, it will overwrite your last note with the new note.***
