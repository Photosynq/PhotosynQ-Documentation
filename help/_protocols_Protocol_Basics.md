### Protocol Basics

Protocols are instructions for Instruments like the MultispeQ on how to run a measurement.

#### Can any Protocol run on any Instrument?

No, Instruments have different configurations, so Protocols might trigger the wrong lights, or request a sensor that is not available. Make sure that the Protocol is compatible with your Instrument.

#### Protocols can be associated with Macros
Macros are small pieces of code that help you analyze a measurement. After a measurement is done, a macro can be applied to make calculations based on the measurement results.


#### Does a Protocol need a Macro?
No, you donâ€™t have to have a Macro for a Protocol. Yet most of the measurements require a Macro since they need to be analyzed further to provide useful information.
