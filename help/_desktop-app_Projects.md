### Projects - Desktop

While most users will use a mobile device in the field to collect data for Projects, the Desktop App provides almost all the features of the mobile app for data collection, as well as a few more for managing Projects.

To work with Projects you can select **Projects** from the left side bar, you can select **View → Projects** from the top menu bar or you can use the shortcut `Ctrl+1 / ⌘1`.

If you create a new Project on the website, it will be automatically listed in your Desktop app under *My Projects** as well.

A list of all available Project questions will displayed and depending on the type of question you will have the following input options:

##### Answering Questions

You have to answer all **Project Questions** in order to contribute a measurement. You can select **Keep Answers** below the **Take Measurement** button, if you take multiple measurement with the same set of answers.

Answers can also be given, by scanning Bar or QR codes (requires webcam). Select the scan icon next to the input field to use your webcam to scan a code. A dialog will be open up and you can select the input source if you have multiple cameras, otherwise the standard camera will be selected. Hold the code in front of the camera to scan it. When the code was read successfully, the dialog will be closed and the code content added into the input field. You can close the dialog at any time using the **Esc** key.

##### Taking a Measurement

Once you have answered all the **Project Questions** you can select the **Take Measurement** button in the right side bar. The measurement will use the protocols listed underneath the button, as well as your **Current Location** as indicated on the small map. If no location information is available, you will see the warning **Unknown Location**. In this case you can still contribute a measurement, just laking the geo tag.

***Note:*** When you push the *Take Measurement** button, the measurement, depending on the Protocol, might start right away.

##### Save Contribution

After the measurement has been taken, you can save the results to the Project using the **Save** button above the measurement results or you can **Discard** the measurement and repeat it. When you want to save your measurement, you can add notes and an image, either using a local file or your webcam and then save it to the Project using the **Save** button at the bottom of the dialog. When you don't have an internet connection your measurement will be cached and submitted to the Project, the next time you have a connection and the app is able to synchronize.
