### Leaf Clamp Button

Push down the leaf clamp button to open the leaf clamp. Push and release with an even motion and prevent it from snapping back. In case the open and closing feels a little rough, a small amount of lithium grease can be used to make the open and closing motion more smoothly.

### PAR Sensor

The PAR sensor located on top of the instrument. When taking measurements, depending on the measurement protocol, the light intensity measured will be replicated inside the instrument. Make sure not to cover or shade the PAR sensor, to prevent altering the actual intensity. Also prevent the sensor from getting dirty.

### Seal

The seal around the light guide on the main body and the clamp is ensuring the area measured is sealed from outside light. The material is  Nitrile.

### Light Guide

The light guide are made from acrylic. Make sure, it is clean and prevent clamping hard materials which can cause scratches.

::: tip
You may need to clean the light guides occasionally. Gently clean the light guides with a damp, soft cloth.
:::

::: danger
Do not submerge in water, do not use solvents or detergents and do not use abrasive or rough cloths to clean the light guides.

### IR Contactless Temperature

The leaf Temperature can be measured with the IR Contactless Temperature. When taking a measurement make sure that the leaf is covering the IR sensor. The sensor is inside a little groove and not flush with the clamp surface. The leaf or material should not touch the the sensor, since it can alter the measured temperature reading.

### Temperature & rel. Humidity Vent

The two vents allowing air to be exchanged inside the Instrument. There are two sensors inside the clamp, one is close to the vents and the light guide, the other one is located on the other end of the clamp. Tubes can be attached in combination with a pump to provide a constant air flow and/or gas exchange.
