## Charging

### Charging takes longer than expected

Try to use a power supply that can provide at least 500 mA, better 1A. If you use a computer USB-port or a power supply with a lower power output, charging can take a lot longer.

### Battery will not charge at all

When the Instrument wasn't used in a long time, the battery might be too empty to start charging. In that case connect the instrument to a charger with 500 mA or better 1A and hold the power/reset button pressed for a few minutes. After that the battery will charge normal again when the button is released.
