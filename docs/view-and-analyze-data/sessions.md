# Sessions

When you are analyzing your collected data you can save your progress as a session. Sessions are also a way of sharing interesting results with collaborators. Shareable Sessions have a unique link that can be shared with others.

**With every session the following parameters get saved:**

1. Selected Series (Filters)
2. Thresholds (if set and applied)
3. Dashboard panels
4. Plot
5. Map position and heat-map settings

::: warning
**Note:** Sessions are **not** saving the exact state, but your settings. So if there are new measurements are added, the session will take those into account as well, the next time you apply a session to your dataset.
