### Connect an Instrument

You can use Bluetooth or USB to connect your Instrument with your device. Depending on the Instrument and device, some connection options may not be available.

For data collection in the field, most people will use the mobile app. So lets focus on connecting the MultispeQ to your android phone. For tips on how to connect to the PhotosynQ desktop app please check out [Connect an Instrument - Desktop](../desktop-application/connect-an-instrument.md) or [Connect an Instrument - Mobile](../mobile-application/connect-an-instrument.md).

**Before connecting your MultispeQ to the Android or Desktop App you need to turn on the MultispeQ by pressing and holding the power button for 5 seconds.** There is no indicator light to let you know if it is turned on.

1. In the app, select the Instrument icon on the top right corner.
2. A list of available Bluetooth Instrument will appear.
3. Below the Instrument name will be its ID. This should match the MAC address on your Instrument (screen A, below)
   - If your Instrument does not appear, click on **SCAN DEVICES**
   - You may have to click **SCAN DEVICES** multiple times before your Instrument appears.
4. Select on the appropriate Instrument.
5. A pop-up will appear asking to pair the device by entering the Instrument PIN. **The PIN is 1234 and is the same for every MultispeQ.**
6. After pairing the MultispeQ, you will be taken back to the Device list. Select your MultispeQ from the list, if the screen B (below) appears your device is connected.
