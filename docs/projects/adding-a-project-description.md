# Project Descriptions

Type in a Project overview, or provide measurement instructions in the Project Description box (you can use [standard markdown](https://daringfireball.net/projects/markdown) to enrich your text).

## Category

Select one or more Project categories from the Category drop down menu that you feel best describe your Project. **At least one Project category is required for each Project.** These categories help users browse and search for Projects.

## Tags

You have the option to add tags to your Projects. An individual tag must be all one word (no spaces).

## Photos

You can add photos to your Project by dragging and dropping them into the photos box or by clicking in the photos box and selecting your photos.
