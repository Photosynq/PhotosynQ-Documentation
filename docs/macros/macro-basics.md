# Macro Basics

All the macros you have developed on PhotosynQ are accessible to you at any time.

Macros are small pieces of code with calculations for Protocols that are run after the measurement is done to evaluate the measurement. Macros are written in [JavaScript].

::: tip Tip
PhotosynQ is providing a number of pre-build functions to make it easier to build Macros and to avoid writing the same code for standard problems like calculating an average over and over again.
