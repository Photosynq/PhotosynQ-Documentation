## Edit a Macro

You can change one of your Macros or extend an already existing one at any time.

1. Select **Macros** from the left menu bar.
2. Double click on the macro in the list or click on **Edit** in the sidebar.
3. Make your changes to the code.
4. Select **Save as...** from the File menu or use the shortcut `CTRL/⌘+⇧+s`.
5. Update the description if needed.
6. Save the changes by **Save As**.

?> **Tip:** In case you altered a macro someone else had made, change the name too. In this case you only have the option **Save as**.

## Save a Macro

Once you are done, save your work and share it with the community.

1. When you have the Macro Editor open, select **Save** from the File menu or use the shortcut `CTRL/⌘+s`.
2. In the save dialog, add a macro name and description.
3. Save the macro by selecting **Save**.

## Connecting a Macro

Once you have the Macro finished, you can open the Protocol in the Protocol Editor and select the Macro from the dropdown list from the menu. Then save the Protocol again to connect the Macro. Now when run, the Protocol will return the calculations that have been done by the Macro after the measurement is done.

## After Macro Updates

When updating a Macro for a Protocol that is used in a Project, the update will impact the data already collected. When opening the Project on the PhotosynQ website to view the data, you will be asked if the data should be reprocessed. This is only available to the Project Lead.

### Troubleshooting

If you have issues saving the macro, make sure you check these things first:

- When a Macro done, make sure the output box is green, indicating that there was no error.
- Make sure you have a name, description.
- Check that the name is not already existing.
