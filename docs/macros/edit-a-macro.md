# Edit a Macro

You can change one of your macros or extend an already existing one at any time.

## Desktop

1. Select **Macros** from the left menu bar.
2. Double click on the macro in the list or click on **Edit** in the sidebar.
3. Make your changes to the code.
4. Select **Save as...** from the File menu or use the shortcut `CTRL/⌘+⇧+s`.
5. Update the description if needed.
6. Save the changes by **Save As**.

?> **Tip:** In case you altered a macro someone else had made, change the name too. In this case you only have the option **Save as**.

### Troubleshooting

If you have issues saving the macro, make sure you check these things first:

- When a Macro is done, make sure the output box is green, indicating that there was no error.
- Make sure you have a name and description.
- Check that the name is not already taken.
