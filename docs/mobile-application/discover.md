# Discover

Not only can you search your own Projects, but you can search through all Projects available on PhotosynQ. Select **Discover** from the Menu and bring up the search input field by tapping on the <i class="fa fa-search" aria-hidden="true"></i> search icon. After entering your query the search returns a list of matching Projects. Tap the project you are interested in to see more details.

## Join a Project

If you search for Projects and you find a Project you would like to participate in, you can join them from the app using the Join button. The Project will automatically add to your list of **My Projects**, as well as in the Desktop application and will also be available under **Collaborations** on your user profile at the website.

::: warning Note
Some Projects cannot be joined, since they are only accessible to a small group of people. These Projects are indicated by a small lock icon in front of the Project title.
