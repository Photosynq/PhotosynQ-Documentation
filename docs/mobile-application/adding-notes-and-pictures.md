# Adding Notes and Pictures

When you are taking measurements with the mobile app, after every measurement you can attach a note and/or picture that will be viewable online. You can add notes or pictures to measurements **AFTER** you have accepted the measurement but **BEFORE** the measurement has been submitted to the website. *Important note:* If the measurement has a green check next to it, it has been submitted to the website and cannot be modified.

To modify a measurement:

1. Go to the Measurements screen on your Mobile App. Press and hold the measurement(s) you want to modify.
2. To delete the measurement, select the *Trash* icon.
3. To add a note, select the *Note* icon from the menu at the top of the screen, type the note into the text-box and select **Save Note**.
4. To add a picture, select the *Camera* icon from the menu at the top of the screen, take the picture and select **OK**

!> **Note:** if you go back and add another note, it will overwrite your last note with the new note.
