# Create / Edit a Protocol

When getting started using the PhotosynQ platform with an instrument like the MultispeQ, several preset measurement Protocols are provided. These Protocols have Macros connected that calculate a defined set of parameters from the measurement data. If your experiment requires more or different parameters or an altered Protocol, you can setup your own measurement Protocol or make changes to an existing one.

## Create New Protocol

1. Make sure you have the Desktop Application installed and you are signed in.
2. Select **New Protocol...** from the File menu.
3. Connect the Instrument you want to use the Protocol with.
4. Start building your Protocol...

::: tip Tip
Use **<i class="fa fa-play"></i> Run** or the shortcut <kbd>Ctrl/⌘</kbd>+<kbd>↵</kbd> to test your Protocol at any time.

## Edit a Protocol

You can change one of your Protocols or extend an already existing one at any time.

1. Select **Protocols** from the left menu bar.
2. Click on the Protocol in the list and click on **Edit** in the sidebar.
3. Make your changes to the Protocol.
4. Select **Save as...** from the File menu or use the shortcut <kbd>Ctrl/⌘</kbd>+<kbd>Shift/⇧</kbd>+<kbd>S</kbd>.
5. Update the description if needed.
6. Save the changes by **Save As**.

::: tip Tip
Often it is easier to start altering an already existing Protocol. To save it change the name too and the only option available is **Save as**.

## Save a Protocol

Once you have finished your Protocol, save your work to use it in your Projects and to share it with the community.

1. When you have the Protocol Editor open, select **Save** from the File menu or use the shortcut <kbd>Ctrl/⌘</kbd>+<kbd>S</kbd>.
2. In the save dialog, add a Protocol name, description and pick a Protocol category.
3. Make sure, the correct macro is connected (not mandatory)
4. Save the Protocol by selecting **Save**.

### Troubleshooting

If you have issues saving the Protocol, make sure you check these things first:

- When a Protocol is finished, no warnings or errors are indicated.
- Make sure you have a name, description and category.
- Check that the name is not already existing.
