# Cloud API

If your custom Instrument is using the correct format for connecting to a PhotosynQ Application and is formatting the Measurements correctly, it can be used with the already existing PhotosynQ infrastructure. This way you can focus on your Instrument and you don't have to worry about recreating the whole backend.

In case you feel, you still want to use the cloud API, drop us a line <support@photosynq.org>.
