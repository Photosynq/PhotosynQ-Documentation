# General

You can build your own custom Instruments and use them together with the PhotosynQ platform.

## Serial Connection

The custom Instrument needs to communicate using the serial protocol, either through USB or Bluetooth.

## Cloud Connection

Your custom Instrument, when following the guidelines of the Instrument API, will have access through the PhotosynQ Applications, taking advantage of the existing PhotosynQ infrastructure.

## API Key

As of now, you don't need an API Key for connecting your custom Instrument to a PhotosynQ Application.
