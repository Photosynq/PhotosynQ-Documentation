# Viewing Data (Online)

As soon as you have uploaded your data from the mobile or desktop app to the website you check it out on the **Data Viewer**.

1. Go to your Project page and click on **View Data** from the left side menu.
2. Wait for your data to load. This can take anywhere from a couple of seconds to a couple of minutes depending on the number of measurements in the Project and the speed of your internet connection.
3. Once your Project data has loaded you will land on your Project's **Dashboard**.

From the **Dashboard** you can choose to graph your data, view it on a map, view it as a spreadsheet, or conduct some simple statistical tests by clicking on the appropriate icon (see below).
