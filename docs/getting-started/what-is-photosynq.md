# What is PhotosynQ

![The PhotosynQ Platform](./images/photosynq-overview.png)

## Design Experiment

The PhotosynQ platform allows you to [design experiments](./projects/create-a-new-project.md) collecting custom sets of meta data with each measurement. These Project questions can be used to filter a dataset or as part of the data collected, like plant size. [Additionally generated data](./projects/import-custom-data.md) can be added to the project after the measurement data collection.

## Collect Data

The data collection is easy and fast using the MultispeQ together with the [Android Mobile Application](../mobile-application/general.md) in the field or with the [Desktop Application](../desktop-application/general.md) in the lab for bench top experiments.

## Analyze Data

The collected data can be analyzed using the online data analysis tools or you can [download](./view-and-analyze-data/download-data.md) data as a spreadsheet or using the provided python or R libraries.

## Connect and Collaborate

Projects on PhotosynQ enables [collaboration](./projects/project-collaborators.md) allowing researchers from anywhere [contribute](./projects/join-a-project.md) to a research Project. Groups around the world can collect data simultaneously and compare results.

## Identify Improvements

Since the data is immediately analyzed, changes or adjustments to the Project can be made instantly. New data can be collected. Previously collected data can be [recalculated](./macros/create-edit-a-project.md) if necessary to improve the data analysis.

## Advancements and Solutions

You are able to connect and discuss results and research progress using the Forums or the Project Discussion.
