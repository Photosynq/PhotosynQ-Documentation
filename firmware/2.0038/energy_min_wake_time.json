  "description": "The value of time is in milliseconds, and must be between zero and 10^6 milliseconds. This setting changes the delay between shutting off the 5V (following `energy_save_timeout`) and the wake up time. The `energy_min_wake_time` is needed to prevent brown out following the initiation of energy save.\n\n**Important:** Note that the change in `energy_min_wake_time` will remain in effect until the instrument is reset, when it will return to the default value of 10 s.",
