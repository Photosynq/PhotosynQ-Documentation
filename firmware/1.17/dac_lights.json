  "description": "When `dac_lights` is set to 1, `pulsed_lights_brightness` and `nonpulsed_lights_brightness` settings will be interpreted by the device as 12-bit values (0 - 4095) directly controlling the LED voltage (via the DAC), instead of microEinsteins (µE * s⁻¹ * m⁻²).  This is used during factory calibration.\n\n**Note:** Setting brightness to high using raw DAC values could permanently disable LEDs, so be careful!",
