  "description": "`environmental_array` defines additional sensors or functionality, just like `environmental`.  However, `environmental_array` returns sensor data once per pulse, as defined in `pulses`.  This allows a string of sensor measurements to be used in a single macro.  The advantage is you can calculate and return in real time things like rates of change, minima and maxima, etc.  See examples for details.  **Note:**  `pulsed_lights_brightness` must NOT be set to zero for any given pulse set for the sensors set in `environmental_array` to measure.",
