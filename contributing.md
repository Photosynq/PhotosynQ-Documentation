# Contributing to the PhotosynQ Documentation

Let's start by saying thank you for being interested in contributing to the PhotosynQ documentation.

We would like to welcome anybody to join in the effort of creating a documentation that is as comprehensive as possible.

## How to contribute

We are aware that there are users with various degrees in technical experience and time that would like to contribute. Because of that, we think knowing about the following options for getting involved might be helpful:

### Bugs

If you found an technical issue like a dead link:

+ Submit an [issue](https://github.com/Photosynq/PhotosynQ-Documentation/issues) through Github
+ If you don't have an Github account, write an email to <support@photosynq.org> with the subject `Documentation - Bug`

### Content Issue, Suggestions or Requests

If you found a statement that is no longer valid, has changed, or you feel like it needs some clarification or you think a chapter is missing:

+ Submit an [issue](https://github.com/Photosynq/PhotosynQ-Documentation/issues) through Github
+ If you don't have an Github account, write an email to <support@photoysynq.org> with the subject `Documentation - Issue`

### New contribution

If you would like to write/edit a chapter, or add/edit images and videos:

+ Fork this repo and submit your changes using a pull request.
+ If you don't have an Github account, write an email to <support@photoysynq.org> with the subject `Documentation - Contribution`

**General:** Make sure to reference which chapter (add a link or the full name) we can find the document you are referring to.

**Format:** All of our documents in this documentation are written in [Github flavored markdown](https://guides.github.com/features/mastering-markdown/). This makes it easy for us to provide documents in different formats, like a website, a pdf or an ebook, without having to manually editing and setting up those documents. If you don't feel comfortable writing your text using markdown, you can always email us just a plain text or word document. We appreciate any kind of help and input!
