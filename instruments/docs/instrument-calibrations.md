# Instrument Calibrations

PhotosynQ Instruments come pre-calibrated from the factory. Over time you can repeat the calibrations to ensure high quality measurements. Depending on the Instrument the available calibrations can vary. Currently you need to use the Desktop Application to adjust your Instrument settings.

::: warning Note
The Mobile Application does not support Instrument Settings.
